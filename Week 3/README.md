## Assignment

We will analyze a dataset from Framingham heart study (FHS, https://framinghamheartstudy.org/). FHS is a cohort study involving thousands of participants over several decades. The study aims to determine factors associating with a cardiovascular disease. Current knowledge about the risk factors for heart disease such as smoking, obesity and chloresterol level were derived from FHS.<p/>

Your tasks are:
1) Create a table summarizing each variable disease and non-disease group (i.e. present representative values such median(IQR) or count(%)).
2) Compare each variable between disease and non-disease group with an appropriate test and put the p-values in the table. Your table should look like this.<p/>

3) Create and select an optimal logisitic regression model that predict whether a participant will develop heart disease.

The dataset can be downloaded (with a registration) from https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/teaching/. The dataset and data dictionary are also available here: https://github.com/GauravPadawe/Framingham-Heart-Study

## Files to be submitted
1. R script for exploratory data analysis and logistic regression analysis. Your R script does not need to create an entire summary table, but it should at least print values in each cell in the table.
2. The summary table (MS Excel or CSV).
