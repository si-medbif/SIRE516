# Team Assignment: KEGG plot

## Motivation
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/). 

KEGG contains an extensive repository of biological pathways that can be integrated with experimental data (e.g. gene ontology enrichment analysis, differential gene expression analysis) allowing the visualization of experimental results within the context of these pathways, potentially facilitating the generation of new research questions and hypotheses. 

## Assignment
Plot the TCA cycle (Krebs cycle) from KEGG. Then use the information from the CSV file (https://github.com/si-medbif/SIRE516/blob/main/Team_Assignments/KEGG/TCA_expression.csv) to fill each gene box/node with color corresponding to the differential expression. Green, Gray and Red are for increased, unchanged and decreased expressions, respectively.  

<b>Optional:</b> Add a legend on the top of the plot.

## Hints
- ggkegg (Bioconductor packages)
