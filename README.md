# SIRE 516: R Programming for Bioinformaticians

## Course description
Skill in R programming language for managing bioinformatic data, exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing, regression analyis, data presentation and visualization.

<b>Course credit:</b> 1 credit<p/>
<b>Course content:</b> 5 sessions of three-hour long classes

## Scoring
- Weekly coding assignments: 60%
  - Take-home: 30%
  - In-class: 30%
- Team project: 30%
- Attendance: 10% 

### Coding assignment grading (10/10)
- R script runs without an error: 5/10
- R script returns a correct answer (both formats and values) for the provided test data: 2/10
- R script returns correct answers (both formats and values) for any possible data: 3/10

### Team project
There are thousands of R packages available in the CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) and Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/) for performing various data analyses and presenting the findings, and it is difficult to cover all of them in this class. The ultimate purpose of this class is to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the R programming language in order to enable them to find and use appropriate R packages for analyzing and visualizing their own data set.  

During the first session, the students will be asked to form a team of 3-4. Each group will select one of "more difficult" assignments and work on it during the course of this class. In the last session, each group of students will present their work (≤ 30 minutes) including:

- Summary of their assignment (Background, Significance, Motivation)
- Describe the input data (Definition of variables, type of variables)
- Explain the code and the workflow
- Explain the analysis/visualization results

### Team project grading (30/30)
- R script runs without an error: 10/30
- R script returns a correct answer for the provided data: 10/30
- Presentation scores given by other students: 10/30

## Grading
- A ≥ 90%
- B+ [80-90)
- B [70-80)
- C < 70%

## Class policies
- <b>Class attendance:</b> Students have to attend no less than 80% (4 classes).
- <b>Tardiness:</b> Students who arrive late for a class by more than 15 minutes are considered to have missed that class (i.e. attendence score will be subtracted).
- <b>Collaboration versus plagiarism:</b> Students are encouraged to discuss about the assignments and help other students. However, copying codes of other students is considered plagiarism which will result in a "0" grade for that assignment.
- <b> AI assistance:</b> Using an AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to completely write an R script for take-home assignments is considered a misconduct and resulting in a "0" grade for that assignment.
- <b>Assignment submission:</b> Each weekly take-homme assignment must be submitted to the instructor (email: dumrongm@gmail.com and CC aksorn.min@mahidol.edu) by the following <b><u>Monday before 9AM</u></b> (i.e. the Monday morning before the next class). A late submission will result in "1" point substraction per calendar day. An R script and a presentation file for the team assignment must be shared with the instructor and other students by 9AM of the presentation day.
